You meticulously recorded all events in your sector: from the arrival of a supply shipment to Dr. Clef's complaints about noise in the neighboring office. Your meticulousness seemed excessive. But it was your entry about 'a strange smell from the ventilation' that helped engineers timely detect a dangerous gas leak. A trifle that saved lives.",

This was a common malfunction that many would ignore. But you immediately reported it to the technical department. It turned out it wasn't a malfunction, but an attempted sabotage. Your attention to detail helped expose a spy.",
